# Understand the Workflow
To set up a loop to buffer roads by road class and type using the BUFFER field as the distance, follow these steps in ArcGIS Pro using Python (ArcPy):

Loop through each unique combination of road class and type in a roads dataset.
Apply a buffer to each road segment using the BUFFER field as the distance.
Save the output as separate feature classes or merge them into a single output.

Explanation of Key Components
Set up workspace: Defines the geodatabase where results will be stored.
Get unique road classes and types: Uses a SearchCursor to retrieve unique combinations.
Loop through each combination: Applies a SQL query to filter roads by class and type.
Select roads: Uses SelectLayerByAttribute to filter based on class and type.
Buffer each selection: Applies the buffer using the BUFFER field dynamically.
Store results: Merges all buffers into a final Roads_Buffered feature class.

Additional Considerations
Ensure the BUFFER field is a numeric field (e.g., Double or Integer).
Modify the script to export each buffer separately if needed.
Adjust buffer parameters (FULL, ROUND, ALL) based on the desired shape.
If working with large datasets, consider running the script as a geoprocessing tool for efficiency.
